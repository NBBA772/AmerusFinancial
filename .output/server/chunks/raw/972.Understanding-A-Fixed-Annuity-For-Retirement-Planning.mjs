In particular, a fixed annuity poses great benefits for those looking to establish financial security through additional income. Essentially, a fixed annuity is a type of insurance contract that promises to pay the buyer a specific, guaranteed interest rate on their contributions to the account. Someone might purchase an annuity if they need to supplement their other retirement income such as social security or pension.\\nAn individual that wants to invest in an annuity can either buy it with a lump sum of money or with a series of payments over time. In turn, the insurance company guarantees that the account will earn a certain rate of interest. This is known as the accumulation phase. When the owner of the annuity is ready to receive a regular income, the insurance company will determine the payments based on the amount of money in the account, the owner’s age, how long the payments are to continue, and a few other important factors.\"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"h2\",\"props\":{\"id\":\"difference-between-a-fixed-and-variable-annuity\"},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Difference Between a Fixed and Variable Annuity\"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"p\",\"props\":{},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"The main difference between a fixed and variable annuity is that a fixed annuity guarantees payments of a set amount based on the term of the agreement.
