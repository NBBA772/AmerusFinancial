An immediate annuity needs a large investment to be beneficial. The average age someone buys this type of annuity is usually between 65 and 70 years old. If you had a million dollars cash laying around and you put it into this type of annuity, you would immediately start collecting monthly payments that would total about $65,000 a year for 20 years (or life depending on the type you purchase).
