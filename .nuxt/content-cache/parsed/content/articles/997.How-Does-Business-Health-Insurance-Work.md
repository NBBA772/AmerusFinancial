Short Term Health Insurance may be an affordable alternative as long as you do not have a Pre-Existing condition. If your income is within the 100-400% of FPL (federal poverty limits) you may qualify for tax credits to help pay for Health Insurance purchased from Healthcare.gov. In addition if your income falls in between 100-200% of the FPL limits you may qualify for a subsidy that can lower your copays and deductibles as well.\nIn addition, you may also want to explore other options for your business such as Association Plans or Affiliate Programs that offer their members a Health Insurance Plan. These plans are typically set up like a traditional group health insurance program yet because of the Large Group Buying Power they are in most cases much more affordable.\nOne such organization is N.B.B.A (National Business Benefit Alliance) and they offer group health benefits to their members. There is a fee to join the organization but they offer benefits that are relevant to small business owners and their employees."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"_6-where-do-i-purchase-business-health-insurance"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"6-Where do I purchase Business Health Insurance ?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Group Health Insurance can be purchased directly from a company or in some cases through an online application.
