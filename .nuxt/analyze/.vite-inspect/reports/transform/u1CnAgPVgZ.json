California Online Privacy Protection\n      ActCalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial\n      websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach\n      stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the\n      United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites\n      collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers\n      to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the\n      information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom\n      it is being shared. – See more at:\n      http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpufAccording\n      to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n\n      <HeadlineTwo>Users can visit our site anonymously.</HeadlineTwo>\n      Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home\n      page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our\n      website.

The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer\n      protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what\n      operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s\n      privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under\n      the age of 13 years old.\n\n      <HeadlineTwo>Fair Information Practices</HeadlineTwo>\n      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law\n      in the United States and the concepts they include have played a\n      significant role in the development of data protection laws around the\n      globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they\n      should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws\n      that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair\n      Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should\n      a data breach occur:\n\n      <HeadlineTwo>We will notify you via email</HeadlineTwo>\n      Within 1 business day\n      <HeadlineTwo>We will notify you via letter</HeadlineTwo>\n      Within 7 business days We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle\n      which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue\n      enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to\n      adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have\n      enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have\n      recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute\n      non-compliance by data processors.\n\n      <HeadlineTwo>CAN SPAM Act</HeadlineTwo>\n      The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,\n      establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the\n      right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough\n      penalties for violations.\n\n      <HeadlineTwo>We collect your email address in order to:</HeadlineTwo>\n      Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions\n      Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.\n      Send you additional information related to your product and/or service\n      Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after\n      the original transaction has occurred.\n      <HeadlineTwo\n        >To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the\n        following:</HeadlineTwo\n      >\n      Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
